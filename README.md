## Analysis Purpose

A business owner in Oahu, Hawaii is looking to open up a surf and ice-cream shop. They want to know temperature trends before opening the shop to determine if their shop will be sustainable year-round.

1. Create two separate queries â”€ one for June and one for December, to retrieve all the temperature data.
2. Convert the temperature data into lists for June and for December.
3. Create two DataFrames from the above lists.
4. Generate summary statistics for the months of June and December temperatures.
